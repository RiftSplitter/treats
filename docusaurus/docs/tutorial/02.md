Now, let's getting deeper into React behaviour.  
The main challenge from a page created with component-based framework, in our case React, is how to make the components could work together in a single page, so it could provide the accurate functionality to user.

To maintain communication between components, React provide two features called __`states`__ and __`props`__.

In a nutshell, __`props`__ is an object passed from parent to child components. To pass __`props`__ to child component, we could do:
```
<SomeComponent 
    prop1={1}
    prop2="some_value" />
```
And to get the props in child component we could use __`this.props.<some_props>`__ (example: __`this.props.prop1`__).

On the other hand, __`state`__ is a way to maintain some value you needed in a component. Remember that __`state`__ cannot be accessed by other component, therefore if you want to pass it to other (child) component, you may want to use __`state`__ with __`props`__.

To use state, we need to initialize it first in our component constructor
```
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
}
```

To set our state we use __`this.setState(state)`__, and to get the state we can directly call it with __`this.state.<some_state>`__ (example: __`this.state.date`__).

If you want to learn more about __`states`__ and __`props`__, please refer to [React Documentation][react docs]

Now let's do some hands-on! We will create a todo page by using __`states`__ and __`props`__.

1. Create new folder named __`todo`__, containing __`index.js`__, __`todo.css`__, and __`list.js`__. Your folder should look like this:
```
todo  
|  
|-- index.js  
|-- todo.css
|-- list.js
```

2. Implement your __`index.js`__
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import AsyncComponent from "@treats/component/async-component";
import './todo.css';
import List from './list';

class Todo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      term: '',
      items: []
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form className="App" onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <input value={this.state.term} onChange={this.onChange} />
          <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
        <List items={this.state.items} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default AsyncComponent(module, Todo);
```

3. Hold a minute! Don't we need a handler function for `onSubmit` and `onChange`? Good question, now lets implement our handler function
```
class Todo extends Component {
  ....
  onChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ term: event.target.value });
  }

  onSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    this.setState({
      term: '',
      items: [...this.state.items, this.state.term]
    });
  }
  ....
}
```
In this part, we could see that everytime our input is changed, our component will update it's `term`.
When submitted, our component will add the `term` in our items. And the items will be displayed in our `List` component.

4. Now let's implement __`list.js`__
```
import React from 'react';

const List = props => (
  <ul>
    {
      props.items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>)
    }
  </ul>
);

export default List;
```

5. Last but not least, don't forget to style our component. Let's implemnet simple style in our __`todo.css`__
```
.App {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 100px;
}
```

6. Oops! One more step before we cross the finish line. Don't forget to register our page in __`route.js`__, __`path.js`__, and __`module.js`__

7. Good job! Now you have create a simple app with basic implementation of __`states`__ and __`props`__.
