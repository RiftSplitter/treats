Good job! Now we will enter a harder part. But don't get overwhelmed yet, we will make sure you understand basic Redux implementation in Treats.

Before we start, have we even talked about Redux yet? No? Okay then, __`Redux`__ is s tools to maintain global state in our app. Maintaining with React __`state`__ and __`props`__ is a great idea, but isn't more convenient when we have a single store of our state, and every component in our app can directly use the state? 
And there comes __`Redux`__ to help! Before start this tutorial we recommend to learn more about Redux [here][Redux].  
Beside __`Redux`__, there is also another global state management tools out there like __`Flux`__ and __`MobX`__. But we will only cover Redux in this tutorial.  
  
Okay, let's get started then.  
1. First thing first, let's create our page first. Create a your page folder like this.
```
reduxpage  
|  
|-- index.js
|-- reduxpage.js
```

2. Implement our `index.js` and `reduxpage.js`.
```
/* index.js */

import AsyncLoader from "@treats/component/async-loader";

const Reduxpage = AsyncLoader({ component: import("./reduxpage") });

export default Reduxpage;
```

```
/* reduxpage.js */

import React, { Component } from "react";
import { connect } from "@treats/redux";

class ReduxPage extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="wrapper">
        <div className="header">
          <div className="age">
            Your age: <span>{this.props.age}</span>
          </div>
          <button className="ageUp" onClick={this.props.onAgeUp}>
            Age UP
          </button>
          <button className="ageDown" onClick={this.props.onAgeDown}>
            Age Down
          </button>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div>History</div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            {this.props.history.map(el => (
              <li 
                className="historyItem" 
                key={el.id}
                onClick={() => this.props.onDelEntry(el.id)}>
                {el.age}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    age: state.reduxpage.age,
    history: state.reduxpage.history
  };
};

const mapDispachToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    onAgeUp: () => dispatch({ type: "AGE_UP", value: 1 }),
    onAgeDown: () => dispatch({ type: "AGE_DOWN", value: 1 }),
    onDelEntry: (id) => dispatch({ type: "DEL_ENTRY", id: id})
  };
};
export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispachToProps
)(ReduxPage);
```

"Okay, I start to see something I've never seen before". Good observation! As we can see in `reduxpage.js`, we can't see __`onAgeUp`__, __`onAgeDown`__, and __`onDelEntry`__ passed from props.  

If you're already read and know Redux basics, this function are our __`dispatch`__ function which allow us to send __`action`__ object to change our current state (In above file, `{ type: "AGE_DOWN", value:1 }` is an action). All these 3 functions will be mapped to component props by __`mapDispatchToProps`__ function.  

What about our `age` and `history`? It's the concept as __`mapDispatchToProps`__, however we mapped the state instead into our props. See the __`mapStateToProps`__ part.  

Lastly, don't forget to __`connect`__ our component with __`mapStateToProps`__ and __`mapDispatchToProps`__. Without this, we can't access dispatch and state as component props. Also, don't forget to __`createStore`__ because Redux need to be initialized first. See the `reduxpage.js` to see how we do __`createStore`__.  

__Note:__ If you're already have experience with Redux before, you will see that we do not need to do __`createStore`__ anymore. _Voila!_ And that's Treats feature for you.

3. Okay that's a lot to learn right? But don't get too carried away, we're not done yet. Next, we'are going to create our __`reducer`__ function.  
Create `_redux` folder under `./src`. Then create a folder representing your module under the `_redux` folder, in this case `reduxpage` and `todo`. Insert your __`reducer.js`__ there. Also, create a global __`reducer.js`__ under `_redux`.
```
/* Folder structures */

src
|-- _redux  
    |-- reduxpage
        |-- index.js
        |-- reducer.js  
    |-- todo
        |-- index.js
        |-- reducer.js
    reducer.js
```
__Notes:__ We recommend to always put Redux-related module in `_redux` folder. This is not mandatory, but it will make our app easy to maintain.

4. Implement our __`_redux/reduxpage/reducer.js`__, __`_redux/todo/reducer.js`__, and __`_redux/reducer.js`__. 
```
/* ./src/_redux/reduxpage/reducer.js */

const initialState = {
  age: 20,
  history: []
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const newState = { ...state };

  switch (action.type) {
    case "AGE_UP":
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age + action.value,
        history: state.history.concat({ id: Math.random(), age: state.age + action.value })
      };
    case "AGE_DOWN":
      return {
        ...state,
        age: state.age - action.value,
        history: state.history.concat({ id: Math.random(), age: state.age - action.value })
      };
    case "DEL_ENTRY":
      return {
        ...state,
        history: newState.history.filter((el)=> el.id !== action.id )
      }
    default:
      return newState;
  }
};

export default reducer;
```


```
/* ./src/page/todo/reducer.js */

const initialState = {
    term: "",
    item: []
};
  
const TodoReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  const newState = { ...state };

  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO":
        return {
            ...state,
            term: "",
            history: state.item.push(state.term)
        };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
  
export default TodoReducer;

```

```
/* ./src/_redux/reducer.js */
import { combineReducers } from "@treats/redux";

import ReduxpageReducer from "./reduxpage";
import TodoReducer from "./todo";

export default combineReducers({
    reduxpage: ReduxpageReducer,
    todo: TodoReducer
});
```
In reducer, we will handle all actions and return the new state after we receive an action.  
Remember to __always__ provide default case (returning previous state) to prevent unintended error or behaviour.  
  
There is also a concept called __`combineReducers`__ which allow you to merge many reducers into a single reducer as we see in `_redux/reducer.js`. Why we need only one reducer? Because Treats only create one Redux store for the whole app, therefore we only need one reducer.  
  
Read more about `combineReducers` [here][Combine Reducers]. 

5. Neat! Our redux page is done right now. Don't forget to add it to our __`routes`__.  
To check the redux behaviour, you may install [Redux Dev Tools][ReduxDevTools] extensions on your browser. There, you can see the Redux state and the state update process. However, you will also need to configure your projects with Redux Dev Tools. Check it [here][Redux Dev Tools Config] to set your Redux Dev Tools.
  
By the way, there are many [Redux state management patterns][Redux Management Pattern] you could use out there. Feel free to explore and choose!
